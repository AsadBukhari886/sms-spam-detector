# ü§ñ AI & SMS Spam Detector

A real-time web application to analyze text messages for spam and detect AI-generated content using a machine learning model and the Groq API.
---

##  How It Works

### üõ°Ô∏è Spam Detection
The backend uses a `scikit-learn` pipeline loaded from `spam_classifier.pkl`. This model was trained on a dataset like the SMS Spam Collection using a TF-IDF vectorizer and a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes). The input text is cleaned and transformed before being fed to the model for prediction.

### ü§ñ AI Content Detection
When a request is made, the backend sends the raw text to the `Groq API`. A carefully crafted system prompt instructs the `Llama 3` model to act as an AI detector and return only a number from 0-100, representing the probability of the text being AI-generated.

##  About The Project

This project combines two powerful text analysis tools into one simple interface:

-   **SMS Spam Detection:** Utilizes a pre-trained model 'Scikit-learn' to classify incoming text messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam" (Ham).
-   **AI Content Detection:** Leverages the speed of the Groq API with the Llama 3 model to estimate the probability that a given text was generated by an AI.

The application features a Python FastAPI backend for the logic and a React frontend for a responsive user experience.

---

##  Features

-   **Dual Analysis:** Get results for both spam and AI content from a single request.
-   **Real-Time Results:** Fast analysis powered by a lightweight model and the high-speed Groq API.
-   **Clean UI:** Simple and intuitive interface built with React.
-   **RESTful API:** A clear and easy-to-use API endpoint for text analysis.
-   **Decoupled Architecture:** Separate frontend and backend for better maintainability and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern technology stack:

#### Backend:
-   [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
-   [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): For building the high-performance API.
-   [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/): As the ASGI server.
-   [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): For the spam classification model.
-   [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/): For loading the trained model.
-   [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/): For managing environment variables.

#### Frontend:
-   [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): For making API requests to the backend.
-   [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS): For styling.

#### Services:

##  Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or higher)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher) and npm
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install the required Python packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file for your API key
    # cp .env.example .env  (if you have an example file)
    ```
    Now, create and open a `.env` file and add your Groq API key:
    ```.env
    GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YourSecretGroqApiKeyHere
    ```
    > **Note:** You can generate `requirements.txt` by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the packages (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`).

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd frontend

    # Install the required npm packages
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Running the Application**
    -   **Start the Backend Server:** In your terminal (from the `backend` directory):
        ```sh
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        ```
        The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

    -   **Start the Frontend Development Server:** In a **new** terminal (from the `frontend` directory):
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
        The React app will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
